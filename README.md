# PortfolioWebsite
(In-Progress) This is my portfolio website where I will showcase my programming projects, interests, and experiences! This website primarily uses html with css style sheets. There is also some Javascript to allow for certain functions, such as how the menu bar works when on the app-mode of the website. This website will be compatible with both phone and laptop screen sizes. Click on the "Landing Page.PNG" file to get a sneak peak at what the main page looks like when running.
